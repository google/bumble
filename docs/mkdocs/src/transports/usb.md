USB TRANSPORT
=============

The USB transport interfaces with a local Bluetooth USB dongle.

## Moniker
The moniker for a USB transport is either:

  * `usb:<index>`
  * `usb:<vendor>:<product>`
  * `usb:<vendor>:<product>/<serial-number>`
  * `usb:<vendor>:<product>#<index>`
  * `usb:<bus>-<port_numbers>`

with `<index>` as a 0-based index (0 being the first one) to select amongst all the matching devices when there are more than one.
In the `usb:<index>` form, matching devices are the ones supporting Bluetooth HCI, as declared by their Class, Subclass and Protocol.
In the `usb:<vendor>:<product>#<index>` form, matching devices are the ones with the specified `<vendor>` and `<product>` identification.

`<vendor>` and `<product>` are a vendor ID and product ID in hexadecimal.

with `<port_numbers>` as a list of all port numbers from root separated with dots `.`

In addition, if the moniker ends with the symbol "!", the device will be used in "forced" mode:
the first USB interface of the device will be used, regardless of the interface class/subclass.
This may be useful for some devices that use a custom class/subclass but may nonetheless work as-is.

!!! examples
    `usb:04b4:f901`
    The USB dongle with `<vendor>` equal to `04b4` and `<product>` equal to `f901`

    `usb:0`
    The first Bluetooth HCI dongle that's declared as such by Class/Subclass/Protocol

    `usb:04b4:f901/0016A45B05D8`
    The USB dongle with `<vendor>` equal to `04b4`, `<product>` equal to `f901` and `<serial>` equal to `0016A45B05D8`

    `usb:04b4:f901/#1`
    The second USB dongle with `<vendor>` equal to `04b4` and `<product>` equal to `f901`

    `usb:0B05:17CB!`
    The BT USB dongle vendor=0B05 and product=17CB, in "forced" mode.

    `usb:3-3.4.1`
    The BT USB dongle on bus 3 on port path 3, 4, 1.


## Alternative
The library includes two different implementations of the USB transport, implemented using different python bindings for `libusb`.
Using the transport prefix `pyusb:` instead of `usb:` selects the implementation based on  [PyUSB](https://pypi.org/project/pyusb/), using the synchronous API of `libusb`, whereas the default implementation is based on [libusb1](https://pypi.org/project/libusb1/), using the asynchronous API of `libusb`. In order to use the alternative PyUSB-based implementation, you need to ensure that you have installed that python module, as it isn't installed by default as a dependency of Bumble.

## Libusb

The `libusb-1.0` shared library is required to use both `usb` and `pyusb` transports. This library should be installed automatically with Bumble, as part of the `libusb_package` Python package.
If your OS or architecture is not supported by `libusb_package`, you can install a system-wide library with `brew install libusb` for Mac or `apt install libusb-1.0-0` for Linux.

## Listing Available USB Devices

### With `usb_probe`
You can use the [`usb_probe`](../apps_and_tools/usb_probe.md) tool to list all the USB devices attached to your host computer.
The tool will also show the `usb:XXX` transport name(s) you can use to reference each device.


### With `lsusb`
On Linux and macOS, the `lsusb` tool serves a similar purpose to Bumble's own `usb_probe` tool (without the Bumble specifics)

#### Installing lsusb

On Mac: `brew install lsusb`
On Linux: `sudo apt-get install usbutils`

#### Using lsusb

```
$ lsusb
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 014: ID 0b05:17cb ASUSTek Computer, Inc. Broadcom BCM20702A0 Bluetooth
```

The device id for the Bluetooth interface in this case is `0b05:17cb`.
