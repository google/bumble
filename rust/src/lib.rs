//! Rust API for [Bumble](https://github.com/google/bumble).
//!
//! Bumble is a userspace Bluetooth stack that works with more or less anything that uses HCI. This
//! could be physical Bluetooth USB dongles, netsim, HCI proxied over a network from some device
//! elsewhere, etc.
//!
//! It also does not restrict what you can do with Bluetooth the way that OS Bluetooth APIs
//! typically do, making it good for prototyping, experimentation, test tools, etc.
//!
//! Bumble is primarily written in Python. Rust types that wrap the Python API, which is currently
//! the bulk of the code, are in the [wrapper] module.
