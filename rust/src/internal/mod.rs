//! It's not clear where to put Rust code that isn't simply a wrapper around Python. Until we have
//! a good answer for what to do there, the idea is to put it in this (non-public) module, and
//! `pub use` it into the relevant areas of the `wrapper` module so that it's still easy for users
//! to discover.
